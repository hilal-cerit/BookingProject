# BookingProject
This project is written with C# language and using ASP.NET Core and EntityFramework Core.
This project was written with a layered architectural understanding.(Which is 4 layers Entities-DataAccessLayer-Business Logic-WebAPI)

In this project   https://uibakery.io/sql-playground used as a database so it is a Database-First EntityFramework approach project.In order to implement this db to the Entity Layer we need these packages to be installed in this layer.
  --*-- Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design
        Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools
        Microsoft.NETCore.App
        Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL
        Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL.Design--*--
And then from package console manager we need to write this command in order to get db tables version of entity classes.
*DB First: Scaffold-DbContext "Host=psql-mock-database-cloud.postgres.database.azure.com;Database=booking1661538931410oilduxjtefmbtrtw;Username=xwwzlphatkrjstcjmzijpjny@psql-mock-database-cloud;Password=xvowrtzabjyowgmtwocwzfrd" Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL -o Models
