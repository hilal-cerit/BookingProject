# BookingProject


This project is written with C# language and using ASP.NET Core and EntityFramework Core.
This project was written with a layered architectural understanding.(Which is 4 layers Entities-DataAccessLayer-Business Logic-WebAPI)

In this project   https://uibakery.io/sql-playground used as a database so it is a Database-First EntityFramework approach project.In order to implement this db to the Entity Layer we need these packages to be installed in this layer.
* Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design
* Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools
* Microsoft.NETCore.App
* Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL.Design

And then from package console manager we need to write this command in order to get db tables version of entity classes.

* Scaffold-DbContext "Host=hostname;Database=databasename;Username=username;Password=password" Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL -o Models



## Prerequirements

The Problem:There isn't any primary keys in table since it's a predesigned db couldn't change it coded the project according to this.
*Layered architecture; it was the development of a project accompanied by basically standardized sections /layers / parts within the framework of certain principles in order to be more conveniently managed and developed in a hierarchical manner
